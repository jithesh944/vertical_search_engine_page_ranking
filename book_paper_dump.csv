Adopting theoretical arguments on personal working experience, we hypothesize that CEOs’ general financial experience may not have a significant impact on their decisions to manipulate earnings while specific experience in audit committee functions will put them in an advantageous position to inflate earnings. Our findings, based on the analysis of 545 UK firms that undertook M&A during 2001-2018, are consistent with these hypotheses. Further investigation reveals that CEOs experienced in audit committees are able to manage earnings as they have specific knowledge on how to reduce the committees’ independence. Our study contributes to the current debate on the efficiency of corporate governance mechanisms by highlighting the importance of specificity of CEOs’ experience.

The existing literature also indicates that the characteristics of CEOs could affect earnings management. This research extends prior studies by examining the relationships between CEO characteristics and accrual-based and real earnings management in share-financed acquirers before a merger announcement. It finds that CEOs with financial expertise, long tenure and high reputation are associated with lower abnormal accruals in share-financed M&A deals. However, under real earnings management, only CEOs with financial expertise are associated with lower real earnings management in share-financed M&A deals. The correlations are statistically significant and consistently exist in the first year before the deal announcement. These findings are robust to different measures of abnormal accruals and real earnings activities and estimations employing different models. The evidence suggests that CEO characteristics have an impact on earnings management in the context of share-financed M&A and have some implications for practitioners.",Feb 2020,['No keywords']

We compare abnormal accruals prior to a mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deal announcement between acquirers that had director networks in the target firms and those who did not. Under cash-financed M&A deals, we do not find a significant difference in accrual earnings management between these two types of firms. Our analysis, however, shows that share- and hybrid-financed acquirers with director networks increase accrual earnings significantly in the first and second years prior to the M&A deal, while those without director networks increase accruals earnings in the first year prior to the M&A deal. Our findings suggest that less uncertainty about the M&A deal and a stronger bargaining position in the negotiations for acquirers with director networks allow these firms to strategically time and confidently inflate their accruals earnings.",28 Jan 2020,['No keywords']

We develop the methods of the extent of updating Web information in two ways, the significance of CSR-related Website Reconstruction (CSRWR), Updateability Rates (URs) of Web CSR contents. Furthermore, investigate how and why the political change, and its consequences, influence the metrics of updateability of Web CSR & sustainability disclosure in that country with special regard on the contrasts between foreign and local ownerships. Research method: around 2000 CSR data records, related to the period from 2008 to 2015, have been collected by accessing more 6000 web pages on websites of 13 major oil companies working Libya. These data have been uniquely analysed to assess commensurably the awareness and significance of CSR & sustainability disclosure in the studied firms. Findings: the crises time clearly influences the performance of firms in website management from CSR & sustainability disclosure perspective. We have deductively reasoned the longitudinal change of the significance of CSRWR, URs of web contents in respect to different types of CSR & sustainability information and different types of ownerships.

Poorer countries tend to suffer more deaths from preventable causes such as communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions when compared to high-income countries. In low-income countries the government health expenditure share in the general government budget is also low and out-of-pocket payments for healthcare relatively high.  They also rely heavily on external resources for health funding, yet sustainability of external resource flows is not guaranteed. This paper explores increasing public healthcare funding from domestic resources mobilisation, and evaluates the impact of measures to achieve this on sectoral growth and poverty reduction rates in Uganda using a dynamic computable general equilibrium model. The paper shows that increasing the government health budget share to facilitate expanded healthcare services which translate into improved population health, is likely to generate higher sectoral growth and reduce poverty in Uganda. The agricultural sector is predicted to post the highest growth when compared to services and industry sectors under both the taxation and aid funding scenarios while national poverty is predicted to decline to less than 10% of the population by 2020. The paper demonstrates that the most effective measure is to generate additional funding for health from a household tax earmarked for health. Policy makers should frontload investment in healthcare and consider domestic resource mobilisation through direct taxation on eligible households.",30 Jun 2017,"['Healthcare financing', 'Uganda', 'Computable General Equilibrium', 'Poverty', 'Economic growth']"

A panel data analytical framework was used to find the determinants of strong corporate governance in Ghanaian listed firms. The empirical results over the whole period, 2000-2009 show statistically significant and positive relationship between external financing needs, firm size, institutional shareholdings and governance quality measured by the Ghanaian corporate governance index. While we find no relationship between external financing needs, director shareholding, firm performance measures and governance quality pre 2003, the result is positive and statistically significant for post 2003. The most consistent relationship we find concerns firm size and institutional shareholdings.

There is also likely to be an indirect effect of political instability through its impact on foreign aid. The net effect is not obvious; violence may discourage aid donors and hence lead to a fall in received aid on the one hand, but it may well lead to an increase in foreign aid as donors offer reimbursement for counterterrorism efforts on the other hand. This paper uses a panel of countries to identify the net effect of armed conflict and terrorism, both domestic and international, on aid receipts. It shows that armed conflict has a negative effect on the amounts of both bilateral and multilateral aid. It also finds that terrorism tends to increase foreign assistance. The effect is stronger for bilateral aid; this is consistent with the expectation that they are likely to use foreign aid to directly or indirectly assist governments fighting terrorism.

Employing three different measures of the auditor’s economic dependence on clients, the study finds evidence in support of the hypothesized link between two of the three measures and discretionary accruals in reporting companies. Extending the investigation, the study also tests whether a threshold level for the relative amounts of audit and non-audit service fees can distinguish between the circumstances when independence may be weakened and when it is not. The results reveal evidence of higher discretionary accruals when the level of non-audit service fees reaches a level of 150% of audit fees but that this relationship is not present when the level rises above 200%, suggesting that auditors may be more conscious of the potential threats to perceived independence when NAS reach this higher level. The study thus provides some evidence in support of the hypothesis that higher NAS fees and total fees to the auditor are positively correlated with the magnitude of discretionary accruals, but also that this relationship is more complicated than implied by a linear regression. The findings add to those of prior studies which have employed accruals based measures of audit quality to test the effect of joint audit and non-audit service provision. The paper also makes a contribution to the continuing policy debate over joint provision reflected in consultations and commentaries on regulation in this area such as the European Commission 2011 proposals for a ban on NAS provision to public interest entity audit clients in Europe and similar discussion in the 2009 report of the UK parliamentary Treasury Select Committee.

Within the cooperation between the Syrian Government and the European Commission and with a budget of over 14 million Euros, the Higher Institute for Business Administration (HIBA) was founded in 2002. This institution is officially considered as the only public business school in Syria, and since its establishment, it attracted many students for both postgraduate and undergraduate. This study aims at identifying the determinants of customer (student)’ satisfaction at HIBA for MBA and EMBA students.Design, methodology and approach: Using a quantitative survey of 52 factors quoted from a study done by Douglas et al (2006) and divided into 7Ps according to Ivy (2008) marketing mix model for business schools, both customer expectations and satisfactions were measured.Findings: For 55 MBA and EMBA students who participated in the study, the descriptive analysis show that students' expectations were high before registering at HIBA, however, during the actual experience of the course, students’ satisfaction diminished. T-test and one way ANOVA showed that there is some variance between feelings of satisfaction for different groups.",12 Apr 2011,"['Higher education marketing', 'Students as customers ', 'Customer expectation', 'Customer satisfaction']"

The study results are based on data collected from 100 universities in UK for the period from 1999 until 2002. Based on nine hypotheses, the study develops a model of entry standards to UK universities. To test the research hypotheses and predict the determinants of the UK universities entry standards, the OLS (Ordinary Least Square) regression is used. The findings of the study indicate that four hypotheses are supported, where a positive association was found between entry standards and the research assessment, first upper second, destination after graduation and efficiency of the study. The other internal capabilities were not found associated with the entry standards including the teaching assessment, staff/student ratio, library/computing and facilities spending, and the age of the university. The study implies that the reputation and the individual aspiration factors as the main predicators for higher entry standards. Implications for some UK universities are included.

A number of hypotheses are investigated including, in particular, FDI-led growth and export-led growth, as well as the reverse linkages from growth to FDI and exports. The importance of human capital is highlighted as complementary to trade and FDI inflows, underlying the importance of technology adoption. We find that, after controlling for domestic investment, government expenditure and imports, support for FDI-led growth is not as strong as export-led growth, although allowing for the joint interaction of FDI and human capital reveals a positive FDI effect above a minimum threshold of human capital, estimated to be around 4.5 years of average secondary schooling attainment. Extending our study using multivariate causality tests conducted within a vector error correction framework, we also find significant effects of domestic investment and trade openness, providing support for import-led growth, but direct support for FDI-led growth as well as growth-led FDI is again relatively weak, reinforcing the conclusion that trade openness has played a more significant role than FDI in influencing Thai economic growth. But the results reveal a subtle role for technology transfer through the complementary effect of trade on FDI, and FDI on government expenditure, which thereby influences human capital development with spillovers onto domestic investment and growth. This leads us to argue that there is a potential role for FDI interacting with human capital in influencing the future development of the Thai economy, given its recently active policy of FDI promotion.",2005,"['trade openness', 'FDI', 'growth', 'VECM', 'technology adoption']"

The French Indochina War (FIW) from 1946-1954 furnishes useful insights with some resonance for current challenges. A combination of pre-exiting conditions, catalysts and operational drivers caused the cathartic 1954 French defeat. Pre-conditions included the illegitimacy of the colonial regime, repression that polarised nationalist sentiment. Economically, pernicious terms of trade suppressed industrialisation but oiled speculation until suddenly reversed by devaluation in 1953 that reflected financial disengagement by France but increased American involvement. Vacillating metropolitan and the dubious colonial regime of the ‘night club’ Emperor, Bảo Đại, fuelled political instability. Militarily, after the disastrous evacuation of the RC4 in 1950, Việt Minh men and supplies poured across the Chinese frontier. In 1954, financial constraints and the looming international peace conference catalysed Navarre, the new French commander, to gamble on a battle of attrition. He bet that the Việt Minh would be unable drag artillery to the remote jungle outpost of Diên Biên Phú, but he underestimated their determination, strength, and adaptability. In early December partisans resented the bungled evacuation of Lai Châu. The entrenched camp’s defences were inadequate and neither infantry sorties nor napalm suppressed VM artillery in the surrounding hills. The French aero-logistical sub-system was overstretched, and significant parachute supplies fell into enemy hands. Navarre scattered his reserves on a futile and remote side show, Operation Atlante. The Americans prevaricated and refused to unleash their B29 fleet. ‘Iacta alea est’ - the die was cast.",7 Aug 2021,"['Indochina', 'Colonial legacies', 'Colonialism', 'Strategic Agility', 'Strategic analysis', 'Foreign Policy', 'Dien Bien Phu', 'Route Colonial 4', 'Vietnam', 'Logistics operations', 'Intelligence Studies', 'Paratroops', 'indigenous peoples', 'land grabbing', 'deforestation', 'Sustainable development']"
